    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12605908/change-background-image-opacity

    Turns out its easier to just edit the background image in Paint.net / GIMP / Photoshop / etc.
    For the "Trail 57" Background I just applied a 50% Gaussian Blur in Paint.net

/*  For the GitHub Section link
    These styles make the GitHub Section header appear white all the time,
    unless hovered on, in which case they turn blue. I like this style better.

    I also decided to use borders instead of underlines since the J in Jason gets cut
    off by an underline, but not by a border (which looks exactly like an underline only
    I can control it better). This resulted in a MUCH nicer looking underline!
    I used this link from Stackoverflow for this:
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9586596/control-underline-position-on-text-decoration-underline

    This class is a fix for a bug I noticed on certain screen resolutions.
    When the width was between ~768px and ~991px (small devices) I noticed that
    the 2x2 rows were not looking right - the first row of 2 squares looked fine
    but the the next row was all messed up, one square was higher than the other.

    It turns out if 2 or 3 squares share the same height but one square doesn't,
    then the alignment is thrown off on the grid.

    This small padding increase fixes the issue by making all 4 squares the same
    height.

      Since the iframe Spotify playlists weren't being centered, I found some CSS that will make them centered:
      https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8366957/how-to-center-an-iframe-horizontally
      Turns out you really just need to use text-align: center, or make it display: block; I also added some padding
      to the bottom for when the screen size gets smaller.
      I am also testing out making the iframes fluid / responsive using these links:
      https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/widgets/adding-widgets-to-websites/
      http://embedresponsively.com/
      https://jsfiddle.net/JMPerez/qa73L/
      To prevent massive spaces on small screens (like mobile devices), I used "height: 80vh" instead of
      "height: 100%" for the height of the iframes. See these links for details:
      https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29730977/how-do-i-set-the-height-of-an-iframe-with-the-min-height-property-in-the-body
